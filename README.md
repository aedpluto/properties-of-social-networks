# properties-of-social-networks
This repository is an analysis of a real-life network of students from several universities. The network is unweighted and directed, and the edges represent the existence of a social relationship between one individual and another (the nodes).

Through calculating a range of network statistics, it was possible to better understand how individuals interacted with each other. Is a person's year group or university more significant in them forming a social tie? Who are the most important individuals within the network? How tight are cliques within the groups? Does the network display small-world or scale-free properties? All these questions are answered within the report accompanying this repository.
